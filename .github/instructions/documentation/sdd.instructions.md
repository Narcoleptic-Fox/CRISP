## IEEE 1016 Compliance

To ensure compliance with IEEE 1016 (Standard for Software Design Descriptions), ensure your SDD contains:

- Identification of the SDD (document control identifiers)
- Design stakeholders and their concerns
- Design views (structural, behavioral, interface, etc.)
- Design viewpoints (rationale, assumptions, constraints)
- Design elements (components, modules, interfaces)
- Design overlays (mappings between views or to requirements)

## Best Practices

- **Consistency**: Use consistent terminology throughout the document.
- **Traceability**: Link design elements back to requirements.
- **Clarity**: Write for the intended audience with appropriate technical detail.
- **Diagrams**: Use diagrams effectively with supporting explanations.
- **Specificity**: Provide specific details, not vague statements.
- **Version Control**: Maintain document versioning and change history.
- **Review Process**: Document should undergo peer review.

## Diagrams to Include

- **Architectural Diagrams**: High-level structure.
- **Component Diagrams**: Component relationships.
- **Sequence Diagrams**: Key interactions.
- **Class/Object Diagrams**: Key data structures.
- **State Diagrams**: For complex state-based components.
- **Deployment Diagrams**: Infrastructure deployment.
- **Data Flow Diagrams**: For data-intensive systems.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

- Focusing too much on implementation details instead of design
- Inconsistent design descriptions across sections
- Lack of rationale for design decisions
- Missing traceability to requirements
- Outdated information
- Too general/vague descriptions
- Neglecting non-functional requirements

## Tools and Templates

- Consider using standardized UML tools like Enterprise Architect, Visual Paradigm, or Draw.io
- Use template repositories with standardized formats
- For collaborative design, consider tools that support concurrent editing
- Consider tools that support traceability to requirements
